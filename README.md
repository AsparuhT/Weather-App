## Installation / Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ````
   git clone https://github.com/AsparuhT/Weather-App.git
   ````

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ````
   cd Weather-App
   npm install
   ````
   
3. **Add your API keys in the .env file as Global variables**
   ````
   # Open Weather Map API key
   REACT_APP_OWM_API_KEY="add your Open Weather API key here"
   # API key for the auto-complete
   REACT_APP_MY_SEARCH_API_TOKEN="if you don't have this key contact me and I will provde it to you"
   ````

4. **Start the App**
   ````
   npm run start
   ````

- **In the branch called auto-complete, you will find further instuctions on setting up the auto-complete API endpoint** 

## Usage

- **Search Weather:** Use the search bar to enter the location you want to check and hit the Enter key to view the corresponding weather data.
- **Auto-complete Suggestions:** As you start typing in the search bar, the app will suggest possible locations. The suggested options are clickable and will show the weather data for that location when clicked on.

## Key Components
The application has two key componnents. One to handle the user input and one to display the results. There are few suplemenotry componts too. The code of each component is very well commented. 

- **Header**: This component is where the search bar is. It handles the user input. Any action or event in the app are triggered though it.
- **Main**: This component is where the weather data is displayed at.

# Testing 

This project utilizes [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as the testing framework and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) for writing unit and integration tests.

To run the tests, use the following command:
````
npm run test
````
It has 3 test suites, incorporating a series of tests primarily focusing on the rendering ability of components. Mock data is passed to the components and the aim is to validate whether the components are rendering correctly and the expected output is being displayed.
