The two files in this branch are the backend of the auto-complete functionality.

- **1. autoComplete.php** - This file receives the fetch call from the weather app, validates it and perform a database query based on the passed query string. It returns array with the found results or rerurns an empty array if no results are found.

- **2. cityList.sql** - That is the MySQL database that contsins a list with the location provided by the Open Weather Map API. 

## Usage

- **Import the database:** Import the .sql file in a MySQL database.
- **Connect the database to the autoComplete.php file:** Adjust the database credentials in that file so it connects to the database.
- **Add its 'my_token' API key:** If you don't have the API key, contact me so I can provide it to you.
- **Adjust the fetch url:** In the Header componend of the app you will find a function called 'getSearchResults' which holds the current API endpoint URL for the auto-complete functioality. Replace it with your own, while retaining the query string it has.
